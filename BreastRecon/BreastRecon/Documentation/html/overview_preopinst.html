            <div class="listheading">Before your surgery date:</div>
            <div class="indent"><ol id="listStyle">
                <li><span class="heavy">SMOKING</span> is known to be one of the most important hindrances to wound healing. The nicotine constricts the blood vessels. Patients who smoke have a higher risk of infection, scarring and wound healing problems. It is imperative that you completely stop smoking at least 4 weeks before, and continue for no less than one month afterwards. Unfortunately, Nicotine patches are just as bad. Please be frank with the doctor and share how successful you have been.</li>
                <li>If you are taking <span class="heavy">ANTICOUAGULANTS (BLOODTHINNERS)</span>, <span class="heavy">ASPIRIN</span>, and/or <span class="heavy">MEDICATIONS CONTAINING ASPIRIN</span> or <span class="heavy">IBUPROFEN</span>, check with your doctor. These must be stopped at least <span class="heavy">1-2 weeks before surgery</span>.</li>
                <li>Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, the day before surgery. Avoid caffeine such as coffee, tea, or chocolate.</li>
                <li>Do not eat anything too heavy or difficulty to digest the day before surgery.</li>
                <li>If you are constipated or have had a problem with constipation, take a daily stool softener for a few days before surgery may be helpful.</li>
                <li>If you are prone to nausea with surgery, let your doctor and your anesthesiologist know this beforehand.</li>
                <li>Remove any fingernail or toe nail polish.</li>
                <li><span class="heavy">A COMPLETE BATH OR SHOWER WITH THE ANTIMICROBIAL SCRUBS</span> provided to you in the pre-op clinic is required the evening before surgery. You do not need to shave.</li>

            <div class="listheading">The day of surgery:</h4></div>
            <div class="indent"><ol id="listStyle">
                <li><span class="heavy">DO NOT EAT OR DRINK</span> after midnight the night before or the morning of your surgery. This includes gum. You may brush your teeth the morning of surgery.</li>
                <li>Take your daily medications with a sip of water (<span class="heavy">except</span> Coumadin, Aspirin, Anti-inflammatory, Insulin, Oral Hypoglycemic) unless otherwise directed by your physician.</li>
                <li>Bring your updated medication list, copy of your surgery consent, and your insurance card with you to the hospital.</li>
                <li>Wear comfortable, loose clothing to the hospital. Wear flat shoes. Two-piece outfits that button, snap, or zip in the front work well.</li>
                <li><span class="heavy">Leave all</span> jewelry and valuables at home. This includes watches, earrings, rings, credit cards, and money.</li>
                <li>Women should remove all makeup before coming to the hospital.</li>
                <li>Leave your contact lenses at home. It is best to wear your glasses.</li>
                <li>Please make arrangements for someone to drive you to and from the hospital. You will usually stay 1-2 nights in the hospital if you have tissue expander reconstruction. If you have flap reconstruction you may stay 4-5 nights.</li>
