            <div class="paragraph-padding"><p><span class="hilite">Combined breast reconstruction with contralateral mastopexy</span>: During a mastopexy (masto = breast, pexy = lift), a sagging breast is lifted by tightening the skin the surrounds the breast tissue. This effectively moves the breast from a low-hanging position to a more “youthful” position on the chest. After mastopexy, the breast will look more full because tightening the skin reverses the deflated appearance. The breast volume is not reduced during a mastopexy because no significant quantity of breast tissue is removed. This procedure is ideal for women that are dissatisfied with the saggy appearance of their breasts but are overall happy with their breast volume. Over time, the breast will begin to sag again due to the effects of gravity on the breast tissue. Mastopexy can be performed through a <span class="hilite">variety of incisions</span>, though is most commonly performed via an inverted T or vertical incision. Other incisions include periareolar and crescent.</p></div>
