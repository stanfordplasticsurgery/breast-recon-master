            <div class="faqanswer">
                You will be able to resume most of your normal activities within 2-4 weeks after surgery if you have had tissue expander placement or implant placement and 6-8 weeks if you had a autologous flap. Please refer to the link to the American Cancer Society for range of motion exercises. You will be evaluated by the plastic surgery team at your post op visits. Referrals to (Physical Therapy) PT can also be done at this time for additional assistance and guidance. If you decide to have PT done at an outside facility, please contact your insurance company and provide the name, phone # and fax # of the facility to your nurse.<p>If you have had breast reconstruction with tissue expander placement, please use caution life long with activities that engage the pectoralis muscle such as planks, push- ups, specific yoga poses, swimming, racket ball...as this may cause the implant to shift. If shifting or displacement occurs, this is not a medical emergency. However, it can be surgically corrected.</p>
