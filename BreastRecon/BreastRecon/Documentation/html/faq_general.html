            <div class="listheading">Insurance Authorizations</div>
            <div class="faqquestion">How do I know that my surgery is paid for?</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">Our surgical schedulers will contact your insurance company to obtain authorization prior to your surgery date. If your claim is denied, then you will be notified. Cosmetic surgery done at the time of your breast reconstructive surgery most likely will be an out of pocket cost. Our surgical schedulers can provide you with the cost estimate.</div>

            <div class="listheading">Disability Forms/Time off Requests/FMLA</div>
            <div class="faqquestion">How does my disability form; time off requests from work; and FMLA paperwork get processed?</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">Once you have a surgical date, you may provide the nurse with the appropriate forms at the time of your pre-op visit. Please allow 1 week to process. For state (EDD) disability, you will need to provide the receipt number or the last 4 digits of your social security number in order for us to process online. You may register electronically at the EDD website or provide an original form. The paper form tends to take longer to be processed and therefore takes longer for your reimbursement. The state requires that we file the claim after you have been discharged from the hospital.<p>If you are having a co-surgery (breast surgery i.e. mastectomy and reconstructive surgery at the same time), the primary breast surgery nurse will be the one who will process all the above requests.</p><p>If you are having delayed breast reconstructive surgery or breast reconstructive revisional surgery or need additional time off due to complications, all requests go to the nurse for breast reconstruction.</p></div>
