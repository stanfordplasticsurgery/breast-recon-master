            <ul id="carelist">
                <li><p><b>Expansion usually starts 2-3 weeks after your surgery, and continues every week or every other week over the next several months. </b></p></li>
                <li><p>During expansion, the tissue expander may feels firm and looks irregular or unsightly. Following exchange of the tissue expander(s) for a permanent implant(s), the breast(s) will feel softer and look more normal</p></li>
                <li><p>You may experience minor discomfort for the following 24-48 hours after each tissue expansion. This discomfort usually subsides 2 to 3 days after each tissue expansion. </p></li>
                <li><p>The tissue expander may shift after the first few expansions. <p></li>
                <li><p>You may experience more discomfort on one side than the other if you have bilateral tissue expanders placed. </p></li>
                <li><p>Your posture may change causing you to have some upper and/or mid back pain during the expansion process. </p></li>
                <li><p>Your shoulder range of motion may become stiff requiring continuing to perform shoulder exercises during the tissue expansion process to prevent shoulder stiffness. </p></li> 
                <li><p>You may find that it is difficult to sleep because you feel heaviness and tightness across the chest and shoulders. This usually subsides with time. </p></li> 
                <li><p>It may be difficult to fit into certain types of tight fitting clothing. You may find it more comfortable to wear oversized shirts with front buttons until the final exchange of the tissue expander(s). </p></li> 
                <li><p>The tissue expander(s) will remain in place for a minimum of 3-4 weeks after the completion of the last tissue expansion. This will allow the soft tissues to heal and recover from being stretched before the second surgery. </p></li>
                <li><p>Secure the drains to your garment with safety pins or use a surgical drain belt to keep the drains from dangling.</p></li>
                <li><p>Do not allow the drainage tubing to kink or twist.</p></li>
                <li><p>Do not pull on the drain tube. Keep a slight laxity in the drain tube at all times.</p></li>
                <li><p>Drains are typically removed in 1-2 weeks when the output is less than 30cc for 2 consecutive days.</p></li>
