            <p>Breast reconstruction can also occur using a combination of the patientâ€™s own tissue and implants. This is offered to patients who has had a flap reconstruction and do not have enough of their own tissue to achieve a desired breast size. An implant may be placed under the flap, in a separate surgery, to augment the breast volume.</p>
