            <div class="paragraph-padding"><p><span class="hilite">Combined breast reconstruction with contralateral breast reduction</span>: For women with large breasts, contralateral breast reduction helps decrease the volume of the unaffected breast to match the size of the reconstructed breast. Breast reductions are generally performed using a <span class="hilite">Wise pattern</span> skin resection or a vertical technique. If a Wise pattern skin resection technique is used, the scar looks like an inverted T extending down from the nipple and horizontally across the lower fold of the breast. In the <span class="hilite">vertical technique</span>, the scar is a vertical line extending from the nipple to the lower breast fold (no horizontal component). Breast reduction can be performed on the breast affected by cancer after lumpectomy depending on size and location of the tumor, and the patientâ€™s breast shape and size.</p></div>
