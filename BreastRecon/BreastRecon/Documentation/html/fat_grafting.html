            <div class="listheading">Typical Post-Operative Symptom</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>You may experience temporary soreness, stinging , throbbing, burning sensation, redness, swelling, bruising  and excess fullness at the recipient sites.</b> Most of these symptoms will subside in 4-6 weeks.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Shiny skin or any itchy feeling:</b> Swelling can cause the breasts’ skin to appear shiny. As the healing process advances, you may also find a mild to severe itchy feeling of the breasts. An antihistamine like Benadryl can help to alleviate severe, constant itchiness. <b>If the skin becomes red and hot to the touch, contact our office immediately.</b></p></li>
				<li><p><b>Temporary swelling, bruising and redness in the donor sites.</b></p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Activities</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Get plenty of rest, but not bed rest.</b> Start walking as soon as possible. This reduces the post-operative swelling and decreases the chance of blood clots. Signs of blood clot in your leg include swelling, warmth, and redness. <b>Contact our office immediately if you develop these symptoms.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>Keep head elevated on 2 pillows while in bed for 3-4 weeks post-operatively. It is preferable that you sleep on your back. Do not sleep on your stomach until instructed by your doctor, usually 3-4 weeks after surgery.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Refrain from physical contact with the breasts for 4-6 weeks.</p></li>
				<li><p>Resume work and social activities in about 3-7 days.</p></li>
				<li><p>Do not drive until you are no longer taking pain medications (narcotics).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Showering and Hygiene</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>You may shower over all your incisions after 48 hours. Pat all incisions dry with a towel after showering.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not take baths or go into the hot tubs or swimming pools until all the drains have been removed and all incisions and drain sites have completely healed.</b></p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Dressing & Incision Care</h4></div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Remove any outer gauze dressing 48 hours after surgery. Do not remove the tape/steri strips or skin glue that are across the incisions.</p></li> 
				<li><p>The tape/steri strips or skin glue will begin to peel away after a few days. After 2 weeks you may remove any remaining tape/steri strips or skin glue.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Examine your incisions daily.</b> It is normal to have some swelling, bruising, and discomfort around the incision site. It may take several days or weeks for these symptoms to resolve.</p></li>
				<li><p>You can apply moisturizer or silicone sheets to your scars or start scar massaging starting 3 weeks after surgery when all the incisions have healed.</p></li>
				<li><p>Avoid sun exposure to scars for at least 12 months after your last surgery. If sun exposure is unavoidable the always use sun block with 35 SPF or higher.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Undergarments</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>If you had fat graft to the breasts, wear a soft, supportive cotton bra, without underwire for 4 weeks. The bra should provide mild even compression, but not constricting.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Wear a compression garment (i.e. spandex type clothing) in the area where the liposuction was performed</b> to harvest the fat for the fat injection <b>for 2-3 weeks</b> post-op.</p></li> 
			</ul>

            <div class="listheading">Diet & Lifestyle</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Avoid cigarette smoking, second-hand smoking, and nicotine products including nicotine gum or patches for at least 4 weeks after surgery. Nicotine causes delayed wound healing and poor circulation.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Drink plenty of fluids (especially water), and eat a balanced diet. Avoid caffeine, soda, tea, and alcohol as they can cause dehydration.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Decreased activity and pain medications can promote constipation, so you may want to add more raw fruit and vegetables to your diet and take a stool softener as needed.</p></li>
				<li><p>You may gradually resume normal activities after 1 week.</p></li> 
			</ul>

            <div class="listheading">Medications</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Take your antibiotic and pain medication as prescribed.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>Resume all your home medications unless you are instructed otherwise by your doctor.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not take aspirin or any products containing aspirin during the 2 weeks after surgery, unless approved by your surgeon.</b></p></li>
				<li><p>Do not drink alcohol when taking pain medications.</p></li>
