            <div class="listheading">Typical Post-Operative Symptoms</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Mid redness</b> along the wound edge not more than ½ inch beyond the incisions</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Slight oozing</b> of fluid and/or blood from the wounds, easily controlled with small gauze.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Crusting</b> of wound edges.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Bruising</b> which may increase over several days.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>The new nipple may look larger than desirable in the beginning.</b> This is a common concern, but most nipples reduce in size significantly as the post-operative swelling resolves over the next few weeks. </p></li> 
				<li><p>The sutures used to assemble the new nipple and areola will dissolve on their own after about 2 weeks.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>There may be wrinkles in the skin around the new areola.</b> This is due to the buried “purse-string” suture which is the key to this process. These wrinkles will smooth out over time as the skin heals.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>The nipple will generally become more swollen and firm over the first week after surgery.</b> Beyond that, it will usually reduce in size and become softer. The nipple size will be more stable after the first month.  The wrinkling that surrounds the nipple will gradually disappear. If the areola is not exactly rounded or is not the right size, this will be corrected with the tattoo.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Activities</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>You may perform all your activities of daily living (i.e. all hygiene routines, housekeeping, cooking, regular work, light exercise, etc.)</p></li> 
				<li><p>Sporting activities that might cause our undergarments to abrade the surgical area should be avoided for 7 days.</p></li>
				<li><p> Do not go swimming in a public pool, the ocean or any other area where the chemical content and bacterial content of the water is unknown until the area is fully healed and all sutures have fallen out.</p></li>
				<li><p>Sexual relations are permissible without restrictions. Be gentle with the fresh surgical area(s).</p></li>
				<li><p>Do not drive until you are no longer taking pain medications (narcotics).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Dressing & Incision Care</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Your new nipple and areola will have been bandaged in the operating room at the end of your procedure. <b>You should remove all these bandages after 48 hours.</b></p></li>
				<li><p>You should shower daily after the first bandages are removed.</p></li> 
				<li><p>When you shower for the first time, you can simply let the water run over the surgical area. Pat the area dry afterwards and you may re-dress the new nipple with some light gauze if you want. You should not try to recreate the dressings that were applied after the surgery.</p></li> 
				<li><p>When you shower, again, wash the surgical area gently, but thoroughly, to remove antibiotic ointment that has been applied. You may use mild soap. <b>DO NOT SCRUB</b>  the surgical area with a wash cloth or be so aggressive that the area bleeds. Normal gentle washing with your hands is adequate. </p></li>
                <li><p>You should use a protective dressing such as a stack of gauze with the center cut out or a nipple shield for one month, except when showering.</p></li>
                <li><p>Tape the dressing or nipple shield to skin or wear inside a soft bra when sleeping to hold in place.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Do not do anything to reduce or hide the nipple. Do not put tape or bandaids over the nipple to try to hide its projection.</b></p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Undergarments</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>For the first few weeks after your surgery or until the new nipple and areola have healed, it is a good idea to war a loose camisole or loose cotton T-shirt to bed each night to protect the surgical area from rubbing on your bed sheets. This will protect the nipple from injury and keep your linens cleaner. Once the area has healed, you may wear or not wear whatever garments you please.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not wear any tight garments which might put pressure on the new nipple for at least one month.</b></p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Diet & Lifestyle</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Avoid cigarette smoking, second-hand smoking, and nicotine products including nicotine gum or patches for at least 4 weeks after surgery. Nicotine causes delayed wound healing and poor circulation.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Drink plenty of fluids (especially water), and eat a balanced diet. Avoid caffeine, soda, tea, and alcohol as they can cause dehydration.</p></li> 
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Medications</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Take your antibiotic and pain medication as prescribed.</b> Call your plastic surgeon immediately if your pain seems to be worsening to the point that you need increasing amounts of pain medication. This may be the first sign of an infection.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Resume all your home medications unless you are instructed otherwise by your doctor.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not take aspirin or any products containing aspirin during the 2 weeks after surgery, unless approved by your surgeon.</b></p></li>
				<li><p>Do not drink alcohol when taking pain medications.</p></li> 
            </ul>
