				<li><p><b>The tattoo area will look red and the colors may seem very intense.</b> The lighter colors may be difficult to see or seem too dark.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Slight oozing</b> of fluid and/or blood from the wounds, easily controlled with small gauze.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Bruising</b> which may increase over several days.</p></li> 
				<li><p>The tattoo color generally fades over the first few months and then it may fade gradually over years. This process is different in different individuals and to some degree different with different pigment colors. The darker colors tend to be more persistent than the lighter colors. Some patients need to be re-pigmented (re-tattoo) over time.</p></li>

	           <li><p>You may perform all your activities of daily living (i.e. all hygiene routines, housekeeping, cooking, regular work, light exercise, etc.)</p></li> 

	           <li><p>Sporting activities that might cause our undergarments to abrade the surgical area should be avoided for 7 days.</p></li>

	           <li><p> Do not go swimming in a public pool, the ocean or any other area where the chemical content and bacterial content of the water is unknown until the area is fully healed and all sutures have fallen out.</p></li>

	           <li><p>Sexual relations are permissible without restrictions. Be gentle with the fresh surgical area(s).</p></li>

				<li><p>Your tattooed nipple and areola will have been bandaged at the end of your procedure. <b>You should remove all these bandages after 24 hours.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>You should shower daily after the first bandages are removed.</p></li> 
				<li><p>When you shower, again, wash the surgical area gently, but thoroughly, to remove antibiotic ointment that has been applied. You may use mild soap. <b>DO NOT SCRUB</b>  the surgical area with a wash cloth or be so aggressive that the area bleeds. Normal gentle washing with your hands is adequate. </p></li>
				<li><p>After you shower, pat the area dry and apply a layer of antibiotic ointment. You may use any “over-the-counter” antibiotic ointment that you have used and have tolerated in the past. This is not a good time to experiment with a new product – some patients are allergic to some of the antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin. If you have had problems with any ointments in the past, you may use plain Vaseline ointment.</b></p></li>
				<li><p>You may cover the area with a light clean dressing to keep from soiling your garments.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Apply the ointment twice daily for 5 days. After that, any moisturizing cream will be useful to keep the area from forming a scab.</b> If the area is allowed to dry out, the tattoo area may scab over and be more uncomfortable, but this does not affect the pigmentation.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Do not tape tightly over the tattoo area directly or try to squash the nipple (which may swell somewhat) in a tight garment.</b></p></li>
				<li><p>The area will be completely healed in about 10 days, but the moisturizing cream should be continued for 6 weeks.</p></li>

            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>For the first few weeks after your surgery or until the new nipple and areola have healed, it is a good idea to war a loose camisole or loose cotton T-shirt to bed each night to protect the surgical area from rubbing on your bed sheets. This will protect the nipple from injury and keep your linens cleaner. Once the area has healed, you may wear or not wear whatever garments you please.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not wear any tight garments which might put pressure on the new nipple for at least 2 weeks.</b></p></li>

            <div class="listheading">Medications</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Tylenol of Ibuprofen should be adequate for most patients. If your pain level is greater than this, you should contact your surgeon. </p></li>
