            <div class="faqquestion" style="margin-top:-1em;">Sexual impact of breast reconstruction</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">Breast reconstruction restores the shape of the breast, but it cannot restore normal breast sensation. The nerve that supplies feeling to the nipple runs through the deep breast tissue, and it gets disconnected during surgery. In a reconstructed breast, the feeling of pleasure from having the nipple touched is lost. A rebuilt nipple has much less feeling.<p>In time, the skin on the reconstructed breast will regain some sensitivity but probably will not give the same kind of pleasure as before mastectomy.</p></div>

            <div class="faqquestion">Effect on your partner</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">Relationship issues are also important because the cancer diagnosis can be very distressing for the partner, as well as the patient. Partners are usually concerned about how to express their love physically and emotionally after treatment, especially surgery. But breast cancer can be a growth experience for couples â€“ especially when partners take part in decision-making and go along to treatments.<p>More information about this can be found in our document Sexuality for the Woman with Cancer</p></div>
