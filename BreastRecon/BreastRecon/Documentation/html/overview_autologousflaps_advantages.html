            <div class="indent"><p>There are several advantages to using autologous tissue for breast reconstruction, including no implant in the body, therefore no implant associated complications (rupture/leak, infection, etc). Additionally, patients receive the benefit of an abdominoplasty or “tummy tuck” if autologous tissue is taken from the abdomen. The breast feels and appears “natural” because it is created from a women’s own tissue.</p>
