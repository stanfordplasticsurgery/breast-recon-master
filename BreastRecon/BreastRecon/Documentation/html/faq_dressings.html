                Outer gauze dressings can be removed 24 hours post operatively. Steri strips stay in place until seen in post op visits. It is okay to shower over them 3 days post op. Usually they start to curl or fall off on their own 7-10 days after surgery. During your visit, the provider may clear you to take off the rest of the steri-strips in the shower.
