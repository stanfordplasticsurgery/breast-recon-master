            <p>Lumpectomy is a breast-conserving surgery where only the tumor and a margin of normal breast tissue surrounding the lesion are removed. Depending on the size and location of the excision, reconstruction may be necessary to restore normal breast volume and contour.</p>

            <div class="indent">
            <p>A lumpectomy that is <span class="hilite">small</span> and is located laterally or inferiorly can often be closed primarily without significant contour change to the breast.</p>
            <p>A <span class="hilite">moderate</span> size lumpectomy may be reconstructed using fat transfer or local tissue rearrangement.</p>
            <p>A <span class="hilite">large</span> lumpectomy often leaves the breast distorted. In patients who are candidates for breast reduction or breast lift (mastopexy), a defect that is located medially or laterally may be removed and the breast reshaped using an anchor-type incision breast reduction/mastopexy approach (Wise pattern). Other large defects may be corrected with an implant or a local flap. Additional fat transfer may be used to enhance breast contour and volume.</p>
