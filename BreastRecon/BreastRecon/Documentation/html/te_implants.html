                <p><span class="hilite">Description:</span> The breast implant is the permanent device that can be placed following use of tissue expander, or in some cases, immediately after mastectomy. Ideal candidates for immediate breast reconstruction with permanent implant include women undergoing prophylactic mastectomy, breast implant volume < 500cc, good mastectomy skin quality, and lack of significant breast ptosis.</p>
                <p><span class="hilite">Implant Placement:</span> During breast reconstruction, the implant is usually placed below the pectoralis major muscle(submuscular). This differs from cosmetic breast augmentations in which the implant can be placed either subglandular (below the breast tissue), or submuscular. Implants for breast reconstruction cannot be placed in a subglandular plane because the breast parenchyma is removed during mastectomy.</p>
                <p><span class="hilite">Saline vs Silicone:</span> Implants are filled with either saline (salt water) or silicone. The outer shell of both implants is a silicone polymer. Current silicone implants are filled with a cohesive silicone gel which is different than the more liquid silicone gel that was used for implants > 10 years ago. Both saline and silicone implants are approved for use in the United States by the FDA. The FDA currently recommends that all women with silicone breast implants undergo MRI of the chest 3 years after placement of the silicone implants, and every other year thereafter to ensure the silicone implant is intact.</p>
                <p><span class="hilite">Round vs Anatomical:</span> Manufacturers have started developing implants that are considered anatomic because the implant is shaped more like a breast than the traditional round or domed implant. All anatomic implants are textured which helps them hold their correct orientation in the body. The surface of round implants can be textured or smooth.</p>
                <p><span class="hilite">FDA Approved Implants:</span> Mentor® saline breast implants, Allergan® saline breast implants, Mentor® MemoryGel silicone gel-filled breast implants, Allergan Natrelle® Silicone gel-filled breast implants, Allergen Natrelle® 410 highly cohesive anatomically shaped silicone-filled breast implants, and Sientra® silicone gel breast implants.</p>
                <p><span class="hilite">Common Complications:</span> The common complications of TE/implant reconstruction include infection, seroma, rupture/deflation, migration, capsular.</p>
