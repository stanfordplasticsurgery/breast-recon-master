            <div class="faqanswer">
                A CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis is a CAT scan that allows visualization of the large and small blood vessels in the lower abdominal wall. It is used to determine the diameter and patency of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vessels and their branches for the purpose of surgical planning in patients who are undergoing breast reconstruction with abdominal tissue transfer. It differs from a regular CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which is typically done for disease diagnostic purposes.
