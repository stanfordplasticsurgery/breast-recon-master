            <div class="paragraph-padding"><p><span class="hilite">Fat grafting</span> involves harvesting fat cells through liposuction, usually from the abdomen, flanks, or buttocks, and injecting the fat under the skin of the breast. Fat grafting is increasingly being used for both cosmetic breast augmentation and to enhance symmetry in breast reconstruction. Over time, the original volume of a fat grafting area tends to decrease. This can require multiple fat grafting procedures to maintain volume. Fat grafting is best used to help correct contour irregularities after reconstruction with implants or autologous tissue.</p></div>
