            <p><span class="hilite">Latissimus dorsi flap</span>: The latissimus dorsi flap uses the latissimus dorsi muscle from the back, with or without overlying skin to reconstruct the breast.  The latissimus dorsi muscle is a broad flat muscle that receives its blood supply from the thoracodorsal artery.  In breast reconstruction, it is transferred as a pedicled flap.</p>
            <p><span class="hilite">Latissimus dorsi flap with TE or implant</span>: The latissimus dorsi muscle flap (with or without overlying skin) can be combined with a TE or implant to give more volume to the reconstruction.  Because the latissimus dorsi muscle is a broad/flat muscle, reconstruction with the latissimus dorsi flap alone can lack sufficient volume, except in small-breasted women.  This flap is useful in women that do not have sufficient abdominal, buttock, or thigh tissue for autologous reconstruction.  The latissimus dorsi myocutaneous (myo = muscle, cutaneous = skin) can also be used to bring healthy skin and muscle to the chest in cases of mastectomy skin flap necrosis, or for delayed reconstruction when the existing skin has been damaged by radiation (thickened and scarred).  Additionally, this flap can be used as a salvage procedure if implant exposure from radiation or infection develops after implant-based reconstruction.</p>
