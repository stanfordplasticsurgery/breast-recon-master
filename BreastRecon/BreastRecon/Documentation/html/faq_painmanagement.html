                You will be given a prescription for pain medication at the time of discharge from the hospital such as Norco (Vicodin) or Percocet. Please take as prescribed. These medications require a hand written prescription by your provider to hand carry to your pharmacy. Please allow 1-2 day lead time for refills so that a provider can write this prescription for you. If you live a distance away, your local physician may need to do this. We anticipate that you will wean off your pain medications within 2-3 weeks of your surgery. Please call for advise on how to taper off your pain medications.<p>If you are having breast reconstruction with tissue expanders, you will be given a prescription for Valium or a medication that will help to relax your muscles. The pectoralis muscle can cramp or spasm as you go through the tissue expansion process.</p><p>Do not drive while taking either pain medications, muscle relaxants or any medication that causes sedation.</p>
