            <div class="listheading">Typical Post-Operative Symptoms</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>You may experience temporary soreness, numbness, stinging, throbbing, burning sensation, redness, swelling, bruising  and discomfort at the surgery sites.</b> Most of these symptoms will subside in 6-8 weeks.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Bruising may be apparent beyond the areas of liposuction, partially due to gravity.</b></p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Activities</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Get plenty of rest, but not bed rest.</b> Start walking as soon as possible. This reduces the post-operative swelling and decreases the chance of blood clots. Signs of blood clot in your leg include swelling, warmth, and redness. <b>Contact our office immediately if you develop these symptoms.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>Activities involving the affected sites should be minimized for approximately 2 weeks.</p></li>
				<li><p>Strenuous exercise and activities such as sports should be avoided for 3-4 weeks, depending on the extent of the surgery.</p></li>
				<li><p>You can usually resume work and social activities in about 1 week.</p></li>
				<li><p>Do not drive until you are no longer taking pain medications (narcotics).</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Showering and Hygiene</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>You may shower over all your incisions after 48 hours. Pat all incisions dry with a towel after showering.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not take baths or go into the hot tubs or swimming pools until all the drains have been removed and all incisions and drain sites have completely healed.</b></p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Dressing & Incision Care</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Remove any outer gauze dressing 48 hours after surgery. Do not remove the tape/steri strips or skin glue that are across the incisions.</p></li> 
				<li><p>The tape/steri strips or skin glue will begin to peel away after a few days. After 2 weeks you may remove any remaining tape/steri strips or skin glue.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>All sutures are dissolvable and do not need to be removed.</b></p></li><li><p><b>Examine your incisions daily.</b> It is normal to have some swelling, bruising, and discomfort around the incision site. It may take several days or weeks for these symptoms to resolve.</p></li>
				<li><p>You can apply moisturizer or silicone sheets to your scars or start scar massaging starting 3 weeks after surgery when all the incisions have healed.</p></li>
				<li><p>Avoid sun exposure to scars for at least 12 months after your last surgery. If sun exposure is unavoidable the always use sun block with 35 SPF or higher.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Undergarments</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>You will be discharged wearing a pressure garment over the treated area. Continue to wear a compression garment (i.e. spandex type clothing) in the area where the liposuction was performed for 24 hours per day (except when showering) for at least 2 weeks post-op.</b> Most patients wear pressure garment for 6-8 weeks.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Diet & Lifestyle</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Avoid cigarette smoking, second-hand smoking, and nicotine products including nicotine gum or patches for at least 4 weeks after surgery. Nicotine causes delayed wound healing and poor circulation.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Drink plenty of fluids (especially water), and eat a balanced diet. Avoid caffeine, soda, tea, and alcohol as they can cause dehydration.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Decreased activity and pain medications can promote constipation, so you may want to add more raw fruit and vegetables to your diet and take a stool softener as needed.</p></li>
				<li><p>You may gradually resume normal activities after 1 week.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Medications</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Take your antibiotic and pain medication as prescribed.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>Resume all your home medications unless you are instructed otherwise by your doctor.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not take aspirin or any products containing aspirin during the 2 weeks after surgery, unless approved by your surgeon.</b></p></li>
				<li><p>Do not drink alcohol when taking pain medications.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">When to Call your Physician</div>
