            <div class="listheading">When should I get my breast reconstruction?</div>
            <div class="indent"><p>Breast reconstruction can be done immediately following mastectomy or delayed after all cancer treatments are completed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="listheading">Who are good candidates for immediate reconstruction?</div>
            <div class="indent"><p><span class="hilite">Immediate reconstruction</span> is best in patients with early stage breast cancer.</p>
            <p>The <span class="hilite">advantages</span> to immediate reconstruction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The patient wakes up with a breast mound, and possibly a fully reconstructed breast.</li>
                <li>The breast footprint and skin envelope are preserved so additional procedures to recreate the breast landmarks and to stretch the skin envelope are avoided.</li>
                <li>The immediate reconstructed breast tends to look more natural.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <span class="hilite">disadvantages</span> to immediate reconstruction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is not a good option for patients with advanced breast cancer where negative tumor margins may not be achieved during the initial cancer surgery, or if extensive adjuvant therapies are needed after surgery.</li>
                <li>Post-operative radiation therapy can compromise the aesthetic results of the reconstructed breast. Revision surgeries may be required.</li>
                <li>Cancer recurrence may require modification or removal of the reconstruction.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="listheading">Who are good candidates for delayed reconstruction?</div>
            <div class="indent"><p><span class="hilite">Delayed reconstruction</span> is recommended for patients with advanced breast cancer or those who are undecided about having reconstruction at the time of cancer treatment. Patients with multiple comorbidities who are not able to tolerate a long surgery are also advised to delay their reconstruction.</p>
            <p>The <span class="hilite">advantages</span> to delayed reconstruction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It allows time to make sure all of the cancer is treated.</li>
                <li>It gives the patient time to decide on a reconstructive option. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <span class="hilite">disadvantages</span> to delayed reconstruction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Absence of (a) breast(s) for a prolonged period of time.</li>
                <li>Takes a longer time to complete the reconstructive process.</li>
                <li>The breast landmarks have to be recreated and additional skin is usually recruited from a donor site for the reconstruction.</li>
                <li>The delayed reconstructed breast tends to look less natural than an immediate reconstructed breast.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="listheading">Are there other options for reconstruction?</div>
            <div class="indent"><p>If you have advanced disease but do not want delayed reconstruction, you can consider <span class="hilite">Staged reconstruction</span>. This involves placing a temporary spacer (tissue expander) at the time of mastectomy to preserve the breast footprint and to keep the skin envelope out to stretch while the patient is completing her cancer treatment.</p>
            <p>The <span class="hilite">advantages</span> to staged reconstruction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows the patient to complete radiation treatment and all cancer treatments before undergoing definitive reconstruction with an implant or a flap.</li>
                <li>Minimizes the loss of breast skin envelope or breast landmarks while waiting for definitive reconstructive surgery.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <span class="hilite">disadvantages</span> to staged reconstruction include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Takes a longer time to complete the reconstructive process.</li>
