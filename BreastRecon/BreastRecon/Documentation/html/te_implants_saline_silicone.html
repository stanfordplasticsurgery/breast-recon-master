            <p><span class="hilite">Saline vs Silicone:</span> Implants are filled with either saline (salt water) or silicone. The outer shell of both implants is a silicone polymer. Current silicone implants are filled with a cohesive silicone gel which is different than the more liquid silicone gel that was used for implants > 10 years ago. Both saline and silicone implants are approved for use in the United States by the FDA. The FDA currently recommends that all women with silicone breast implants undergo MRI of the chest 3 years after placement of the silicone implants, and every other year thereafter to ensure the silicone implant is intact.</p>
