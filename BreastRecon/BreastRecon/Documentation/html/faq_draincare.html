            <div class="faqquestion">What happens if my drain starts to fall out?</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">Do not reinsert drain as this will cause contamination and possible infection. You may call your nurse during the work day or the plastic surgeon on call after hours for further instruction. They may guide you into how to remove the drain.</div>

            <div class="faqquestion">How do I monitor for infection with the drain?</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">At the drain site itself where it inserts into the skin, check for increased redness, swelling, creamy yellow discharge. If this is present, you may have an infection and will need to notify a plastic surgery team member. Also assess the drainage itself for increased cloudiness, thickening, foul odor. If this is noted, please notify a plastic surgery team member. It should be a watery consistency either red or straw colored. <p>.In addition, cleanse the skin around the site of the tubing with plain soap and water gently and rinse, pat dry, and reapply clean gauze dressing daily or as needed. Be sure to keep drain site covered with gauze and tape at all times.You may also cleanse area with 1/2 strength hydrogen peroxide and apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment daily.</p></div>

            <div class="faqquestion">When do the drains get removed?</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">The drains are removed once the output of the individual drain has reached 25-30 ml or less for 2-consecutive days in a row. Most often, the drains are removed in approximately 10 days for breast drains and 2-3 weeks for abdominal drains. You most likely will have them removed at the time of your post op appointment. However, arrangements can be made to have them removed if they are not ready at that time.</div>
