            <p><span class="hilite">Acellular Dermal Matrix:</span> Tissue reconstruction can be performed with or without the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM). ADM is a biologic material that is created by removing cells from the dermis of deceased humans (cadavers) or animals (pig and cow). The dermis is the layer of our skin, deep to the epidermis, that provides much of the strength to our skin. This material is often used in immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders or implants to support/reconstruct the lower portion of the breast. Commonly used biologics include Alloderm® and Surgimend®.
