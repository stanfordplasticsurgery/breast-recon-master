            <p><span class="hilite">Implant Placement:</span> During breast reconstruction, the implant is usually placed below the pectoralis major muscle(submuscular). This differs from cosmetic breast augmentations in which the implant can be placed either subglandular (below the breast tissue), or submuscular. Implants for breast reconstruction cannot be placed in a subglandular plane because the breast parenchyma is removed during mastectomy.</p>
