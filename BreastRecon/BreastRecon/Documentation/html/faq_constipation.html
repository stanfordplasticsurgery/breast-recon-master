                It is not unusual to experience constipation post operatively due to either the surgery itself which can slow down GI motility or the pain medications. You will be given a stool softener prescription at the time of discharge. However, this only softens the stool, if you are having difficulty, you may try milk of magnesia or miralax along with increasing your activity (walking), fluid intake and fiber intake. If after two days, you do not have a bowel movement, please notify a plastic surgery team member.
