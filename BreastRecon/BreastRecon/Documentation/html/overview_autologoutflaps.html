            <div class="indent"><p><span class="hilite">Autologous tissue based reconstruction:</span> Autologous tissue based reconstruction means using your own body tissue (largely skin and adipose) to recreate a breast. The donor site is defined as where tissue is taken from. This can be your abdomen, buttock, thighs, or back. Many factors contribute to donor site selection including a patient’s body habitus and size goals for the reconstructed breast. The donor site tissue is often referred to as a “flap”. A flap is defined as tissue that is moved from one area of the body to another while maintaining its own blood supply.</p>
