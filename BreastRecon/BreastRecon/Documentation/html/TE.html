            <div class="listheading">Typical Post-Operative Symptoms</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Tightness in the chest or back region and stiffness; Tingling, burning or intermittent shooting pain:</b> These are normal experiences as the skin, muscles and tissue stretch to accommodate your implants, and as sensory nerves heal. Pain medication and muscle relaxants will help you cope with any discomfort. If you have drains, you may experience additional localized discomfort.  <b>Consistent sharp pain should be reported to our office immediately.</b></p></li>
				<li><p><b>Shiny skin or any itchy feeling:</b> Swelling can cause the breasts’ skin to appear shiny. As the healing process advances, you may also find a mild to severe itchy feeling of the breasts. An antihistamine like Benadryl can help to alleviate severe, constant itchiness. <b>If the skin becomes red and hot to the touch, contact our office immediately.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Asymmetry, the breasts look different, or heal differently.</b> Breasts may look or feel quite different from one another in the days following surgery. This is normal; no two breasts are perfectly symmetrical in nature or following breast reconstruction surgery.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>A sloshing sound or sensation:</b> This is not the result of your implant filler, but rather of air that is trapped in the implant pocket and fluid that may naturally accumulate. This is perfectly normal and will resolve within 2-4 weeks.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Activities</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>Get plenty of rest, but not bed rest.</b> Start walking as soon as possible. This reduces the post-operative swelling and decreases the chance of blood clots. Signs of blood clot in your leg include swelling, warmth, and redness. <b>Contact our office immediately if you develop these symptoms.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>Keep head elevated on 2 pillows while in bed for 3-4 weeks post-operatively. It is preferable that you sleep on your back. Do not sleep on your stomach until instructed by your doctor, usually 3-4 weeks after surgery.</p></li>
				<li><p> Do not drive until you are no longer taking pain medications (narcotics).</p></li>
				<li><p>Avoid strenuous activities. Do not lift anything heavier than 5-10lbs for 3-4 weeks post-operatively.</p></li>
				<li><p>Keep your arm(s) on the surgery side(s) within 45 degrees of your chest wall for the first 2 weeks.</p></li>
				<li><p>We will start you on range of motion and strengthening exercises for your shoulders and arms after 2 weeks.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Showering and Hygiene</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>You may shower over all your incisions, including the drain sites, after postoperative day 3. Pat all incisions and drain sites dry with a towel after showering.</p></li> 
				<li><p>When showering, you can tie a piece of string or yarn and loop the drains together so that you can wear them like a necklace, this will keep the drains from dragging in the shower.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not take baths or go into the hot tubs or swimming pools until all the drains have been removed and all incisions and drain sites have completely healed.</b></p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Dressing & Incision Care</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Remove the outer gauze dressing 48 hours after surgery. Do not remove the tape/steri strips or skin glue that are across the incisions.</p></li> 
				<li><p>The tape/steri strips or skin glue will begin to peel away after a few days. After 2 weeks you may remove any remaining tape/steri strips or skin glue.</p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Examine your incisions daily.</b> It is normal to have some swelling, bruising, and discomfort around the incision site. It may take several days or weeks for these symptoms to resolve.</p></li>
				<li><p>You can apply moisturizer or silicone sheets to your scars or start scar massaging starting 3 weeks after surgery when all the incisions have healed.</p></li>
				<li><p>Avoid sun exposure to scars for at least 12 months after your last surgery. If sun exposure is unavoidable the always use sun block with 35 SPF or higher.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Undergarments</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Wear a supportive, cotton, sports bra, without underwire, 24 hours a day for 4 weeks. This will help to minimize bruising and swelling. After 4 weeks you can just wear it during the day. The bra should provide compression, but not constricting.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Drain Care</div>
            <ul id="carelist"> 
				<li><p>You will have Jackson Pratt or JP drains, this is a bulb drain that is put underneath your skin to drain fluid from around the incision. The squeeze bulb on the end of the drain creates a gentle suction which helps to remove the fluid.</p></li> 
				<li><p>You will be instructed on how to empty and measure your drainage prior to your discharge from the hospital. Please refer to the drain care instruction sheet for additional details.</p></li> 
				<li><p>You may change the dressing around the drain sites daily and as need to keep it clean and dry.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Diet & Lifestyle</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p>Avoid cigarette smoking, second-hand smoking, and nicotine products including nicotine gum or patches for at least 4 weeks after surgery. Nicotine causes delayed wound healing and poor circulation.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Drink plenty of fluids (especially water), and eat a balanced diet. Avoid caffeine, soda, tea, and alcohol as they can cause dehydration.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Decreased activity and pain medications can promote constipation, so you may want to add more raw fruit and vegetables to your diet and take a stool softener as needed.</p></li> 
				<li><p>You may gradually resume normal activities after 4-6 weeks.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">Medications</div>
            <ul id="carelist"> 
				<li><p><b>Take your antibiotic and pain medications as prescribed.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p><b>Do not take aspirin or any products containing aspirin during the 2 weeks after surgery, unless approved by your surgeon.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>Resume all your home medications unless you are instructed otherwise by your doctor.</p></li> 
				<li><p>Do not drink alcohol when taking pain medications.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">BE AWARE</div>
            <ul id="carelist">
				<li><p><b>You cannot have an MRI if you have tissue expanders in place.</b></p></li> 
				<li><p>The tissue expanders may be detected via security scanners at the airport. You will need a note from your doctor if you plan to travel indicating that you have tissue expanders containing a medal port in place.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="listheading">When to Call your Physician</div>
