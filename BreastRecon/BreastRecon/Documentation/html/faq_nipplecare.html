            <div class="faqanswer">
                Your reconstructive plastic surgeon may use either antibiotic ointment, xeroform and a bulky dressing or a nipple guard instead of a bulky dressing to protect your nipple immediately following the procedure. You may remove these dressings after 24-48 hours and shower. Please follow the “Nipple Reconstruction” instructions under “After Surgery” tab.

            <div class="listheading">Nipple Tattoo</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">
                You may decide to have your nipple and aerolar complex tattooed or just the aerola around the reconstructed nipple. This process usually takes place approximately 2-3 months post surgery. The breast tissue will need a chance to recover from surgery as swelling is common postoperatively. Allowing this time to heal not only helps with having accurate placement of the nipple/aerola but it will also allow the tattoo color to be better absorbed into the skin. Having a nipple tattoo is a painless process and takes approximately 1 hour in our outpatient office. Our nurse practitioner will tailor the color specifically to you. You may drive yourself to and from this appointment.
