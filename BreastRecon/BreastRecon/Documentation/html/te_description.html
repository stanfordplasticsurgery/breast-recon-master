            <p><span class="hilite">Description:</span> A tissue expander is a silicone shell with an access port that allows for inflation and deflation of the device. It can be thought of as a balloon that is used to stretch the chest skin following breast surgery. As the tissue expander (balloon) is filled with saline (salt water), the volume in the device increases which stretches the skin. The tissue expander can be placed in an immediate, or delayed fashion. Immediate refers to tissue expander placement immediately after mastectomy, while delayed refers to a gap in time (can be months to years) between mastectomy and tissue expander placement.
