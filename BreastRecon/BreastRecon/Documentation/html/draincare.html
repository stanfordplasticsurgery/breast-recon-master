            <ul id="carelist">
                <li><p><b>Please bring your drain recording sheet to each clinic visit until all drains are removed.</b></p></li>
                <li><p>Empty your drains when they become half full or every 12 hours, which ever comes first.</p></li>
                <li><p>Unplug the bulb cap to allow the bulb to expand. Measure the fluid level in the bulb (in cc’s) using the numbered markings on the bulb while holding it upright. Alternatively, the fluid may be emptied into a measuring cup. Record the measured amount in your recording sheet.</p></li>
                <li><p>Discard the drainage after measuring the amount. Do not save it.<p></li>
                <li><p>The amount and color of the drainage will vary. It may start as a bloody color  and eventually become more pink and into a yellow or straw color.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once the drain is emptied, compress the bulb until it is completely deflated, then recap it. This will recreate suction in the bulb.</p></li>
                <li><p>Strip the drain tubing every time you empty the drains to remove any clots in the tubing. Hold the tube securely at the drain exit site with two fingers of one hand. Then, take two fingers of your other hand and squeeze the tube gently together while pulling down the tube towards the bulb.</p></li> 
                <li><p>A small amount of drainage at the drain exit site is normal. Keep a dry dressing over the drain site to absorb any drainage and to prevent the drain from rubbing against your clothing.</p></li> 
                <li><p>You may shower with your drains after post-operative day 5. Remove all dressings around the drains and replace with new dressings over the drain exit sites after washing.</p></li> 
                <li><p>No baths until all drains have been removed and all drain sites have completely healed.</p></li>
                <li><p>Secure the drains to your garment with safety pins or use a surgical drain belt to keep the drains from dangling.</p></li>
                <li><p>Do not allow the drainage tubing to kink or twist.</p></li>
                <li><p>Do not pull on the drain tube. Keep a slight laxity in the drain tube at all times.</p></li>
                <li><p>Drains are typically removed in 1-2 weeks when the output is less than 30cc for 2 consecutive days.</p></li>
            </ul>
