                In order to properly plan your surgery as well as document the results of your surgery, a member of the reconstructive plastic surgery team will take photographs of the surgical sites only. Your face and other identifying marks are not included and your name does not appear next to the photograph. All pictures are confidential and are kept as part of your medical record. They may be used to educate the reconstructive plastic surgery team and/or other patients who may be interested in surgical outcomes. You have the right to decline this request.
