        <div class="listheading">Tissue Expansions</div>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            Tissue expansions usually start 1-2 weeks after surgery in the office. You may have 3-6 expansions once weekly or every other week to reach desired size for the implant.<p>During the tissue expansion process, you will not feel pain, but rather pressure, particularly during the first few expansions.</p><p>Sizing is based on the how well you tolerate the expansions and the desired cup size. Ideally you will be over expanded one time past desired size to prepare for the second surgery where your tissue expanders are exchanged for implants.</p><p>Once the tissue expansions are complete, you will be ready for the second stage (removal of the tissue expander and placement of the implant) in 1-2 months. However, if you have had radiation therapy treatment, you will have the second stage in 3-6 months depending on the quality of your skin.</p><p>The tissue expander contains a metal port. Therefore, you will not be able to have an MRI as this causes scatter and can distort the image. Ultrasound is acceptable.</p><p>In the event that you travel with the tissue expander in place, you may request a letter to bring to the airport explaining that you have a medical device with a metal port in your chest. It is safe to fly with the tissue expander. However, there is a small chance that the tissue expander may leak with the changes in altitude. Do not be alarmed as this is not life threatening. The tissue expander may be refiled after you return from your trip.</p>

        <div class="listheading">Tissue Expanders/Breast Implants &amp; Radiation Therapy</div>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            Whether you already had or will have radiation therapy, there is a higher likelihood of complications with your breast reconstruction surgery such as capsular contracture (thickening of the scar tissue (capsule) around the implant); wound healing complications and/or infection with a tissue expander or an implant in place.<p>If you have a tissue expander in place, you will be over expanded on the side you are to have radiation treatment in order to compensate for skin changes/shrinkage and toughening of the skin post completion of radiation treatment. You will not have expansions done while you are undergoing radiation treatment.</p><p>If you have radiation, the exchange can be 3-6 months after completion of radiation, depending on the quality of the skin. This allows appropriate healing time and reduce the risk of wound healing complications post operatively. Check skin daily, keep it moisturized and contact us immediately if there are any signs of new redness or swelling.</p><p>If you are having radiation therapy at an outside facility, please arrange a follow up appointment with your breast surgery reconstruction team within 2 weeks of completing your treatment. Since radiation causes skin changes and increases the risk of infection and wound complications, we want to monitor your skin and incision sites closely.</p><p>Please advise your radiation oncologist that he/she may contact us with any questions or concerns as you are going through radiation therapy treatment.</p>

        <div class="listheading">Tissue Expansions During Chemotherapy</div>
        <div class="faqanswer">
            We will need to coordinate your tissue expansions with your chemotherapy appointments. In order to safely proceed with expansions, we typically will schedule your appointments on the same day, the day before, or the day after your chemotherapy. We will need the blood test results showing your total WBC (white blood cell count) to be no less than 3.0 in order to proceed with tissue expansions. We will also monitor your Platelet Count. If your WBC or Platelet Count is too low, then your risk of infection or bleeding is greatly increased and the tissue expansion date will need to be postponed.<p>If you are having your chemotherapy at an outside facility, it is imperative we have your blood test results prior to your arrival to your appointment.</p><p>Once the chemotherapy is completed, then the second stage of your breast reconstructive surgery (exchange of tissue expander for the implant) is approximately 3 weeks up to several months later to allow the necessary time to recover. It is also normal that it may take longer to heal from your incisions after receiving chemotherapy. You will need to closely monitor for any signs and symptoms of infection at the surgical site(s).</p>
