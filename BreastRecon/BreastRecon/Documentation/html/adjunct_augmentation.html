                <li><span class="hilite">Implant</span>: If a breast augmentation is performed using an implant, a silicone or saline implant can be used, and the implant can be placed over or under the pectoralis major muscle, as previously described. The implant can be placed through various incisions. </li>
                <li><span class="hilite">Autologous tissue</span>: The breast can be augmented using autologous tissue in the form of the flaps previously described (TRAM, DIEP, SGAP, etc), or through fat grafting. If a flap is used, the existing breast tissue is elevated from the underlying muscle and the flap is placed below the breast tissue.</li>
