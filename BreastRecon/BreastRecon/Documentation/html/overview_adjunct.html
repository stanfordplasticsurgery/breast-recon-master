            <div class="listheading">Introduction</div>
            <div class="paragraph-padding"><p>Significant asymmetry can result between a woman’s breasts after lumpectomy or mastectomy for breast cancer involving one side. Various operations can be performed on the contralateral side (the breast unaffected by cancer) to achieve symmetry. These include breast reduction, mastopexy, breast augmentation, and mastopexy/breast augmentation. Contralateral surgery for symmetry is an option for all women regardless of whether the reconstruction was performed with autologous tissue, tissue expanders/implants, or a combination of autologous tissue and implants.</p></div>

            <div class="listheading">Breast Reduction</div>
            <div class="paragraph-padding"><p><span class="hilite">Combined breast reconstruction with contralateral breast reduction</span>: For women with large breasts, contralateral breast reduction helps decrease the volume of the unaffected breast to match the size of the reconstructed breast. Breast reductions are generally performed using a <span class="hilite">Wise pattern</span> skin resection or a vertical technique. If a Wise pattern skin resection technique is used, the scar looks like an inverted T extending down from the nipple and horizontally across the lower fold of the breast. In the <span class="hilite">vertical technique</span>, the scar is a vertical line extending from the nipple to the lower breast fold (no horizontal component). Breast reduction can be performed on the breast affected by cancer after lumpectomy depending on size and location of the tumor, and the patient’s breast shape and size.</p></div>

            <div class="listheading">Mastopexy</div>
            <div class="paragraph-padding"><p><span class="hilite">Combined breast reconstruction with contralateral mastopexy</span>: During a mastopexy (masto = breast, pexy = lift), a sagging breast is lifted by tightening the skin the surrounds the breast tissue. This effectively moves the breast from a low-hanging position to a more “youthful” position on the chest. After mastopexy, the breast will look more full because tightening the skin reverses the deflated appearance. The breast volume is not reduced during a mastopexy because no significant quantity of breast tissue is removed. This procedure is ideal for women that are dissatisfied with the saggy appearance of their breasts but are overall happy with their breast volume. Over time, the breast will begin to sag again due to the effects of gravity on the breast tissue. Mastopexy can be performed through a <span class="hilite">variety of incisions</span>, though is most commonly performed via an inverted T or vertical incision. Other incisions include periareolar and crescent.</p></div>

            <div class="listheading">Augmentation</div>
            <div class="paragraph-padding"><p><span class="hilite">Combined breast reconstruction with contralateral breast augmentation</span>: The size of the breast can be increased (augmented) using an implant or autologous tissue.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="hilite">Implant</span>: If a breast augmentation is performed using an implant, a silicone or saline implant can be used, and the implant can be placed over or under the pectoralis major muscle, as previously described. The implant can be placed through various incisions. </li>
                <li><span class="hilite">Autologous tissue</span>: The breast can be augmented using autologous tissue in the form of the flaps previously described (TRAM, DIEP, SGAP, etc), or through fat grafting. If a flap is used, the existing breast tissue is elevated from the underlying muscle and the flap is placed below the breast tissue. <p><span class="hilite">Fat grafting</span> involves harvesting fat cells through liposuction, usually from the abdomen, flanks, or buttocks, and injecting the fat under the skin of the breast. Fat grafting is increasingly being used for both cosmetic breast augmentation and to enhance symmetry in breast reconstruction. Over time, the original volume of a fat grafting area tends to decrease. This can require multiple fat grafting procedures to maintain volume. Fat grafting is best used to help correct contour irregularities after reconstruction with implants or autologous tissue.</p></li>
