            <div class="faqquestion">What happens if you gain/lose weight after breast reconstruction surgery?</div>
            <div class="faqanswer">If you had an autologous tissue transfer surgery, then you would gain or lose weight in your breast the same way you would in your abdomen. If you gain or lose weight (i.e. 5-10 lbs) after an implant surgery, the size and shape of your breast will most likely not change. However, if you loose greater than 10 lbs, you may experience sagging.</div>
