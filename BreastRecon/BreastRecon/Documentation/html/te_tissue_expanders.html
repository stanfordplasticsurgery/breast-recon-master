                    <span class="hilite">Description: </span>Tissue expander/implant based reconstruction means using prosthetic devices (tissue expanders followed by permanent implants, or immediate placement of permanent implants) to reconstruct the breast. No autologous tissue is used in the reconstruction.</p>

                    <p><span class="hilite">Tissue Expanders</span> A tissue expander is a silicone shell with an access port that allows for inflation and deflation of the device. It can be thought of as a balloon that is used to stretch the chest skin following breast surgery. As the tissue expander (balloon) is filled with saline (salt water), the volume in the device increases which stretches the skin. The tissue expander can be placed in an immediate, or delayed fashion. Immediate refers to tissue expander placement immediately after mastectomy, while delayed refers to a gap in time (can be months to years) between mastectomy and tissue expander placement.</p>

                    <span class="hilite">Tissue Expansion Process:</span> Filling the tissue expander with saline occurs in the clinic setting and starts approximately 2-3 weeks post-operatively. Expansion ensues for weeks to months, depending on the desired fill volume of the expander. 3-4 weeks after the goal breast volume is achieved, the tissue expander can be exchanged in the operating room for a permanent implant.</p>
               <p>
                    <span class="hilite">Types:</span> Several companies make tissue expanders including Allergan®, Mentor®, and Sientra®. Slight structural variations exist between tissue expanders including shape, number of filling chambers, and the location of the filling port (internal port versus remote port).</p>

                    <span class="hilite">Acellular Dermal Matrix:</span> Tissue reconstruction can be performed with or without the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM). ADM is a biologic material that is created by removing cells from the dermis of deceased humans (cadavers) or animals (pig and cow). The dermis is the layer of our skin, deep to the epidermis, that provides much of the strength to our skin. This material is often used in immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders or implants to support/reconstruct the lower portion of the breast. Commonly used biologics include Alloderm® and Surgimend®.</p>
