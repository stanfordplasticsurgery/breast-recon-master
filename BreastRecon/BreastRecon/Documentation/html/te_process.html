            <p>  <span class="hilite">Tissue Expansion Process:</span> Filling the tissue expander with saline occurs in the clinic setting and starts approximately 2-3 weeks post-operatively. Expansion ensues for weeks to months, depending on the desired fill volume of the expander. 3-4 weeks after the goal breast volume is achieved, the tissue expander can be exchanged in the operating room for a permanent implant.
