            <div class="indent"<p>Disadvantages include a longer operation (typically 6 hours for a unilateral reconstruction with free tissue transfer, and 8-12 hours for a bilateral reconstruction with free tissue transfer), longer hospitalization (4-6 days compared to 1-2 days with tissue expander/implant based reconstruction), and longer recovery period due to need to heal flap donor site (abdomen, thighs, buttocks, back). Patients can have wound healing complications from mastectomy skin flap necrosis, and flap failure if the blood supply becomes compromised. Additionally, patients can have hernia formation or bulges after abdominal tissue transfer from the abdomen.</p>
